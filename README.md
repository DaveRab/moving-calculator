# Moving Calculator App
This is a personal project that I'm working on to further understand data structures and arrays.  Once completed it will be a moving calculator that users can use to calculate the size of their move in cubic feet.

## Roadmap
Moving Calculator app will allow users to calculate how much cubic feet their stuff will take up when it comes time to move.  Users input the items name and dimensions which will then update the table on the page displaying the items.  At the bottom the page will tell the user their total cubic feet.

### HTML PAGE
1. 5 text inputs
  * Name
  * Height
  * Width
  * Depth
  * Qty
2. Submit button
3. Table to display information
  * Name
  * height
  * width
  * Depth
  * Qty
  * Cubic feet
  * Total Cubic Feet (At bottom)

### JS
1. Array of objects for each item entered
2. Push new items to list
3. Update the table on page
4. Functions for CRUD operations
5. Calculate total cubic feet in table and keep table up to date (map new array using cu ft prop?)
